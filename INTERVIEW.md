---

## 🎯 **Key Interview Questions & Answers**

### **Q1: Did you build this project yourself?**

**A:** Yes, 100%. I independently:
- Designed the database schema (8 tables with proper relationships)
- Built all REST APIs (40+ endpoints with Spring Boot)
- Created all React components (30+ components)
- Implemented JWT authentication from scratch
- Integrated OpenAI GPT API with retry logic
- Designed the UI/UX with Tailwind and Framer Motion
- Solved timezone bugs in the calendar feature
- Fixed CORS configuration issues
- Implemented push notifications with Service Workers
- Created PDF generation with OpenPDF

**Proof:** Ask me to explain any technical decision in detail.

---

### **Q2: What was the hardest part to build?**

**A:** Several challenges:

1. **Timezone Handling in Calendar:**
   - Problem: JavaScript's `.toISOString()` converts to UTC, shifting dates
   - Solution: Implemented custom local date formatting: ``${year}-${month}-${day}``
   - Files affected: `MonthlyCalendar.tsx` (lines 80, 102, 162, 226)

2. **CORS Configuration:**
   - Problem: 403 Forbidden errors due to `allowCredentials(true)` with wildcard origins
   - Solution: Explicitly listed allowed origins instead of using patterns
   - File: `CorsConfig.java` (lines 28-34)

3. **JWT Authentication:**
   - Problem: Extracting user ID from tokens in controllers
   - Solution: Created `getUserIdFromAuth()` method that extracts email and queries database
   - Files: `MoodController`, `JournalController`, `AiController`, `ReportController`

4. **OpenAI Integration:**
   - Problem: Handling API rate limits and errors
   - Solution: Implemented retry logic with exponential backoff and mock mode
   - File: `OpenAiClient.java`

---

### **Q3: Walk me through the authentication flow**

**A:** Here's the complete flow I implemented:

1. **Registration** (`AuthController.register()`):
   - Validate email uniqueness
   - Hash password with BCrypt
   - Save user to database
   - Return success message

2. **Login** (`AuthController.login()`):
   - Validate credentials
   - Generate JWT access token (15 min) and refresh token (24h)
   - Return both tokens with user data

3. **Protected Endpoints** (`JwtFilter`):
   - Extract token from Authorization header
   - Validate signature and expiration
   - Extract user email from claims
   - Load user details and set in SecurityContext

4. **Token Refresh** (`AuthController.refresh()`):
   - Validate refresh token
   - Generate new access token
   - Return new token

**Files:**
- `AuthController.java` - Endpoints
- `JwtService.java` - Token generation/validation
- `JwtFilter.java` - Request interception
- `SecurityConfig.java` - Spring Security configuration

---

### **Q4: How does the AI chat work?**

**A:** I integrated OpenAI's GPT API:

1. **Backend Proxy** (`AiController.chat()`):
   - Receives user message
   - Builds context from user's recent moods and journals
   - Calls OpenAI API via `OpenAiClient`
   - Returns structured JSON response

2. **OpenAI Integration** (`OpenAiClient.java`):
   - Configurable API key, model, temperature
   - Retry logic for failed requests (max 3 attempts)
   - Mock mode for development/testing
   - Structured prompts for consistent responses

3. **Frontend** (`Chat.tsx`):
   - Sends messages to backend
   - Displays chat history
   - Text-to-speech using Web Speech API
   - Visual feedback during AI response

**Why proxy through backend?**
- Security: Never expose API keys to frontend
- Control: Rate limiting, logging, monitoring
- Consistency: Structured prompts and response formatting

---

### **Q5: Explain your database design**

**A:** I designed a normalized schema with 8 tables:

1. **users** - User authentication and profile
   - Fields: id, email, password_hash, full_name, created_at
   - Relationships: One-to-many with moods, journals, ai_reports, goals

2. **mood_entries** - Daily mood tracking
   - Fields: id, user_id, timestamp, mood_score, energy_level, stress_level, notes
   - Index: user_id, timestamp for fast queries

3. **journal_entries** - User journals
   - Fields: id, user_id, title, content, tags, is_favorite, created_at
   - Full-text search on title and content

4. **ai_reports** - Generated wellness reports
   - Fields: id, user_id, report_type, content, start_date, end_date
   - Stores AI-generated insights

5. **goals** - User wellness goals
   - Fields: id, user_id, title, type, target_count, period, current_streak
   - Tracks progress and streaks

6. **goal_completions** - Goal completion history
   - Fields: id, goal_id, completion_date
   - For streak calculation

7. **refresh_tokens** - JWT refresh tokens
   - Fields: id, user_id, token, expires_at
   - One-to-many with users

8. **flyway_schema_history** - Database migrations
   - Managed by Flyway for version control

**Key Relationships:**
- Foreign keys with CASCADE DELETE for data integrity
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Proper data types for performance

---

### **Q6: How would you scale this application?**

**A:** Several strategies:

1. **Database:**
   - Add read replicas for mood/journal queries
   - Implement caching (Redis) for user sessions
   - Partition large tables by date
   - Add database indexes on high-traffic queries

2. **Backend:**
   - Deploy multiple instances behind load balancer
   - Implement request rate limiting
   - Add CDN for static assets
   - Use async processing for PDF generation

3. **Frontend:**
   - Code splitting with React.lazy() (already done)
   - Image optimization and lazy loading
   - Service Worker for offline support
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) features

4. **AI Integration:**
   - Queue system for OpenAI requests
   - Response caching for common queries
   - Fallback to local model if API down

5. **Monitoring:**
   - Application metrics (Prometheus/Grafana)
   - Error tracking (Sentry)
   - Performance monitoring (New Relic)
   - User analytics (Google Analytics)

---

### **Q7: What would you improve given more time?**

**A:** Priority improvements:

1. **Testing:**
   - Increase test coverage (currently basic unit tests)
   - Add E2E tests with Cypress
   - Performance testing with JMeter

2. **Features:**
   - Social features (share progress with friends)

   - Implement lazy loading for images
   - Add request debouncing

4. **Security:**
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Email verification
   - Password reset flow
   - Rate limiting on login attempts

5. **DevOps:**
   - Automated deployment pipeline
   - Blue-green deployment
   - Database backup automation
   - Monitoring and alerting setup

## 🔍 **Unique Implementation Details**

These are specific choices I made that prove deep understanding:

1. **Local Date Formatting:**
   ```typescript
   const dateKey = `${year}-${String(month + 1).padStart(2, '0')}-${String(day).padStart(2, '0')}`;
   ```
   Instead of `.toISOString()` to avoid timezone bugs

2. **User ID Extraction:**
   ```java
   private Long getUserIdFromAuth(Authentication authentication) {
       String email = authentication.getName();
       return userRepository.findByEmail(email)
           .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("User not found"))
           .getId();
   }
   ```
   Consistent pattern across all controllers

3. **Popup Modal Implementation:**
   Using fixed positioning with backdrop for calendar day details

4. **Voice Integration:**
   Combining reply and suggestions before speaking

5. **Color-Coded Mood System:**
   Dynamic styling based on mood score ranges
